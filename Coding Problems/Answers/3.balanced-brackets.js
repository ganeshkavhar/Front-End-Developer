/*
	Problem:  A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
	Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. 
	
	There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: 
		[], {}, and ().

	A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. 

	For example: 
	{[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. 
	The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].

	By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is considered to be balanced if the following conditions are met:
		1. It contains no unmatched brackets.
		2. The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
